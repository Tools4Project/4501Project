# 4501Project：Image Style Transfer and Building a Gui
## Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to enable users to transfer the style of their images, either an uploaded image or an image captured by their computer built-in camera when they click on the button **upload via camera** into any style they prefer, for example, it can provide the users with the magic capacity to paint like Vincent van Gogh!<br> 
A GUI is built to make it more easily to be operated by the users, especially the layman without the necessity to understand the code. Additionally, the working process and the final result can be more observable.<br>

## Convolutioonal neural Network (CNN)
CNN is a technique introduced by Gatys et al. (2015) in their paper 'Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Network'. The algotithm allows us to separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. In another words, it is capable of extracting content information from a image and then extract style information from a famous artwork, then combine them together to produce a new image that possesses the content of the photo and the appearance of a given artwork. The key idea backed up this algorithm is to optimise an image with the objective of matching desired CNN feature distributions, which involves both the photo's content information and the artwork's style information.<br>

You can now go to the **Example** section to firstly have a basic idea before reading the specific **code** part.<br>
