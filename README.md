# 4501Project：Image Style Transfer and Building a Gui
## Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to enable users to transfer the style of their images, either an uploaded image or an image captured by their computer built-in camera when they click on the button **upload via camera** into any style they prefer, for example, it can provide the users with the magic capacity to paint like Vincent van Gogh!<br> 
A GUI is built to make it more easily to be operated by the users, especially the layman without the necessity to understand the code. Additionally, the working process and the final result can be more observable.
